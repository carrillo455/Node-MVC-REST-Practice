# Node-Express MVC-REST BASIC APPLICATION
This practice is based in my other project 'Simple-PHP-Crud'.

##Interfaces
The views are exactly the same, but they are rendered from pug,
which is a template engine for handling and setting data directly from the server.

##API
The MVC pattern was implemented, therefore it has one router, one controller and 3 models.
The requests are completely _restful_.

##Database
No ORM was used, the connection to MySQL engine are managed with the MySQL Package.
